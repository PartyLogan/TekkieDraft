# Tekkie Draft
A draft mode for tekken 7 based off dota 2 captains mode rules

See it in action here: https://partylogan.github.io/tekkiedraft/

A basic website for doing a Dota 2 style captains mode drafting 5v5 match in tekken.
Has timers for picking and banning which are manually controlled. Drag and drop character icons, manually entered player names and a search/filter box

Everything is base javascript with no extensions or plugins. Made to be manual while making things easier to organise than other methods.
